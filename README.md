# Name Bazaar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/district0x/name-bazaar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/district0x/name-bazaar)

A peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service.

See at [https://namebazaar.io](https://namebazaar.io)

Smart-contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar/tree/master/resources/public/contracts/src).

## Starting a dev server with an Ethereum Testnet

First, clone the project with submodules _([ens](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens))_

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar.git
```

in case you already downloaded the repo, or forgot to clone the submodules, use
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

By default, working with submodules is tedious, and the defaults are not great
either. Git doesn't checkout the submodules to the correct version (e.g. on pull,
checkout) by default. You can override the git settings by:

```bash
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

In a terminal, start a ganache blockchain

```bash
./run-ganache.sh
```

_(note that this uses docker and will try to pull `trufflesuite/ganache-cli:v6.12.1` image if you don't have it)_

Open another terminal, start autocompiling smart-contracts

```bash
lein auto compile-solidity
```

_(You need to have `solc` with compatible version installed. See `contracts` folder to determine the
correct version)_

Open another terminal, start a repl and build the dev server (with
figwheel repl)

```bash
lein repl
(start-server!)
```

Figwheel will prompt for a connection for the repl instance.

Open another terminal, run the compiled server script, which should
connect to the figwheel repl.

```bash
node dev-server/name-bazaar.js
```
_(If you have problems re-running this command, try removing `dev-server`
folder and try to start the server again)_

#### Redeploy smart-contracts and generate mock data

```bash
# In the figwheel server REPL run:
(redeploy)
```

Redeployment / Generation can take a long time, please be patient.

#### Start server with custom config

Namebazaar uses [district-server-config](https://github.com/district0x/district-server-config) for loading configuration. So you can create `config.edn` somewhat like this:

```clojure
{:emailer {:private-key "25677d268904ea651f84e37cfd580696c5c793dcd9730c415bf03b96003c09e9ef8"
           :print-mode? true}
 :ui {:public-key "2564e15aaf9593acfdc633bd08f1fc5c089aa43972dd7e8a36d67825cd0154602da47d02f30e1f74e7e72c81ba5f0b3dd20d4d4f0cc6652a2e719a0e9d4c7f10943"
      :use-instant-registrar? true}
 :logging {:level :info
           :console? true}
 :web3 {:port 8549}
 :endpoints {:port 6200}}
```

## Start dev UI

If you wish to connect to the dev server discussed above, open a
separate terminal, and build the client-side ui

```bash
lein repl
(start-ui!)
```

You can then connect to the server through a web browser at http://localhost:4541

### Semantic UI

To build the Semantic UI pieces of the app you need to have `gulp` installed.
Note that `gulp 4.x` does not work, you need a `3.x` version.

`npm install gulp@^3.9.0 --save`

Then use our handy script:

`./semantic.sh build`
or
`./semantic.sh watch`

Depending upon how you'd like to work.

## Updating ens contracts

We use ENS as a submodule to track the dependency on it's contracts. If you are in
`contracts/ens-repo` directory, you can use

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -
git log --pretty=oneline --reverse --ancestry-path HEAD..master
```

to first update the ens repository and then list the commits in ens `master` branch, which are
not in our version of `ens-repo`. _(You can use this list of commits when updating to the latest
version of ens contracts)_

Exemplary workflow may look like this:
1) Running the commands above gives me the commits in ENS I want to update.
   Let's say: `6141359670af83974340e6492e6830125783ccaa`

2) You can then use `git checkout 6141359670af83974340e6492e6830125783ccaa`.
   This will checkout the files of that commit.

3) The namebazaar repository will report changes in this submodule when you
   execute `git status` _(outside the ENS repo)_.

4) These changes **should be** committed together with the update of
   namebazaar code.

## Start a development UI for client-side development only

If you're only focusing on working with the UI, you can start a UI
interface which connects to the production server using mainnet.

```bash
lein repl
(start-ui! :ui-only? true)
```

In separate terminal, start the supplied docker nginx server

```bash
docker-compose build nginx
docker-compose up nginx

# Visit website at http://localhost:3001
```

**Note: using this client is using the main ethereum network, it is
ill-advised to carry out transactions unless you know what you are doing!**

## Backend (server) tests:

```
lein doo node "server-tests"
```
_(If you have problems running the tests, try to remove `server-tests` directory
and try re-running the tests again)_

The doo runner will autobuild the test and re-run them as the watched files change.
Alternatively:

```
lein cljsbuild once server-tests
node server-tests/server-tests.js
```

## Frontend (browser) tests:

```
lein doo chrome browser-tests
```

It will autobuild browser-test and re-run the tests as the watched files change.
More info: [https://github.com/bensu/doo](doo).

## Development env through nginx:

```
docker-compose build nginx
docker-compose up nginx
```

and start (start-ui!), (start-server!) as usual, but open the site on http://localhost:3001

## Build for production

Following commands are used to build system for production

```bash
lein build-prod-server
lein build-prod-ui
lein build-css

# To build all 3 in parallel use
lein build-prod

# To run prod server
node server/name-bazaar.js
```

## Linting and formatting

The purpose of linting and formatting is such that the code is readable and consistent.

We use [ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint) for linting solidity files. You
can use `lein npm ethlint` and `lein npm ethlint-fix` to run the linter.
