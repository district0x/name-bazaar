     [:p "Name Bazaar provides the ability for any user with a name for sale to generate unique smart contracts that allow transfer of ownership of that name to a new Ethereum address and owner, and receive payment in return. Any user with Ethereum looking to buy a name can do so through these contracts by interacting with the website."]
     [:p "No registration or sign up is required. All you need is an Ethereum address available through the " [a "https://metamask.io/" "MetaMask"] " or " [a "https://github.com/paritytech/parity-extension/releases" "Parity"] " browser extensions. Every time you take an action that requires confirmation on the blockchain, you will be asked to confirm that transaction via MetaMask or Parity. This will require a small fee in Ethereum to perform the operation (this fee goes to the Ethereum Network, not to Name Bazaar)."]
